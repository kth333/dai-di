Dai Di Game Instructions and Rules

Objective:
The aim of Dai Di is to be the first to get rid of all the cards in your hand. This is achieved by outmatching your opponents' cards with higher-value cards played singly or in specific poker combinations. The game allows 2 cards, 3 cards, or 5 cards combinations.

Card Values:
- Cards ascend in value from 3s (lowest) to 2s (highest).
- Suit values ascend from diamonds (lowest), to clubs, hearts, and spades (highest).
- Therefore, the 3 of diamonds is the weakest card, while the 2 of spades is the strongest.

Starting a Game:
- Each player draws 13 cards.
- The player with the 3 of diamonds starts the round, setting the precedent for the number of cards (single or combination) to be played.

Turns:
- Players play in a clockwise direction, trying to play higher-value cards or combinations.
- A player may pass if unable to play a higher card or combination.
- If all players pass, the last player to play starts a new round with a card or combination of their choice.

Combinations:
1. Two cards (pair): Cards of the same number. Must be outmatched by a higher pair or a higher suit if the number is the same.
2. Three cards (triplet): Three cards of the same number. Beat with a higher triplet.
3. Straight: Five consecutive cards, regardless of suit.
4. Flush: Five cards of the same suit, any numerical order.
5. Full House: A triplet and a pair combined.
6. Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same number, plus any other card.
7. Straight-Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit.

Combination Strength:
Straight-Flush > Four of a Kind > Full House > Flush > Straight
