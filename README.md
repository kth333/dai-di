**compile.bat and run.bat batch files**
The compile.bat file compiles all your Java source files and automatically stores them in the classes directory. The run.bat runs your application.

**src**
This directory contains all your Java source files.

**classes**
This directory should be left empty during submission. After compile.bat runs, the class files will be stored here automatically.

**images**
This directory contains any image files used by your application. It will be empty if you build a console application.

**lib (if using any external libraries)**
This directory contains any jar files that you use for your application.

Good luck and have fun! :)
