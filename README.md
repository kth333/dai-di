### compile.bat and run.bat batch files
The compile.bat file compiles all your Java source files and automatically stores them in the classes directory.
The run.bat runs your application.

### src  
This directory contains all your Java source files. 

### classes
This directory should be left empty during submission. After compile.bat runs, the class files will be stored here automatically.

### images
This directory contains any image files used by your application. It will be empty if you build a console application.

### lib (if using any external libraries)
This directory contains any jar files that you use for your application.
